	YEAR = {1985},
	Annotations = {Peano's axioms:
1. There exists a natural number @. (this symbol should be phi)
2. For each natural number, there exists another unique natural number (@')
   called the successor of @.
3. @ is not the successor of any natural number.
4. x'=y' implies x=y.
5. If & is a set of natural numbers such that 
   (a) & contains @.
   (b) & contains x' whenever it contains x,
   then & is the set of all natural numbers.

a+b may be defined as:
(i) a+b=a'+pred(b), for b#@,
(ii) a+@=a. }
